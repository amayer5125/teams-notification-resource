# DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT

I use these pipelines and docker-compose to test the Teams connector.

Feel free to contribute examples of pipelines that you use and for which you 
would like to ensure regression protection.

```
docker-compose up -d
```

User:pwd is `test:test`.  I shouldn't have to say don't expose this to a network.
